#Task 1:

Meltdown is a timing-based side-channel attack that exploits out-of-order execution in modern CPUs. It bypasses the CPU's privilege separation to access kernel memory, which is normally protected. By utilizing speculative execution, the attack reads kernel memory and measures timing differences to infer sensitive data (Kocher et al., 2018). This vulnerability primarily affects Intel CPUs manufactured before 2018, as well as some ARM and AMD processors. Systems based on x86 architecture, such as desktops, laptops, servers, and virtual machines, are particularly vulnerable (Intel Security Center, 2018).

Through this side channel, Meltdown can leak sensitive information stored in kernel memory, including passwords, cryptographic keys, and other critical data that user-level programs should not have access to (CVE-2017-5754 Documentation). While there is no publicly confirmed case of Meltdown being exploited in real-life attacks, its discovery in 2018 raised significant concerns about the potential for misuse, particularly in targeted or pre-disclosure scenarios (Kocher et al., 2018).

The vulnerability has been addressed through both software and hardware updates. Operating systems implemented Kernel Page-Table Isolation (KPTI), which ensures that kernel memory is separated from user processes. Additionally, CPUs manufactured post-2018 incorporated hardware-based changes to prevent speculative execution from accessing privileged memory spaces (Intel Security Center, 2018). These mitigations have significantly reduced the risk posed by Meltdown in modern systems.

#Task 2:
The Slowloris Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack works by exploiting the way web servers handle HTTP headers. It sends partial HTTP requests and keeps these connections open for as long as possible by periodically sending more headers without completing the request. This prevents the server from closing the connections, consuming server resources, and blocking legitimate traffic (OWASP Slowloris Project, 2021).

What makes Slowloris unique compared to high-bandwidth Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks is its low resource requirement. Instead of overwhelming the server with a massive flood of traffic, it uses a small number of requests to monopolize the server's connection pool. This makes the attack stealthier and more targeted, as it requires minimal bandwidth from the attacker while still achieving significant disruption (Ristic, 2013).

The effects of a Slowloris attack are severe for targeted servers. It consumes all available connections, leading to slow responses or complete inaccessibility for legitimate users. Servers that are older or poorly configured are particularly vulnerable, as they may lack safeguards against prolonged connections or resource exhaustion (CVE-2009-3555 Documentation).

Mitigating Slowloris involves several strategies. Configuring servers to reduce connection timeout durations and limit the maximum number of open connections per IP address is effective. Using reverse proxies, load balancers, or web application firewalls (WAFs) helps to filter out malicious requests. Additionally, intrusion prevention systems (IPS) and rate-limiting techniques can restrict repeated requests from the same source, further protecting against this type of attack (Arbor Networks, 2021).

Notable instances of Slowloris attacks include its use during the Iranian presidential protests in 2009. Activists used the method to disrupt government websites, demonstrating its effectiveness as a low-resource attack to target online services (Cloudflare, 2021).

#Task 3:

Tools Installed
BurpSuite Community Edition: Downloaded and installed from PortSwigger's official site.

For installation, I created a temporary project with default settings and accessed the dashboard.

Docker Desktop: Already installed and configured to run Docker containers.

Verified functionality by running the hello-world test image.

DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application):

Pulled the DVWA image using:
code:
docker pull vulnerables/web-dvwa


Ran the container using:
code:
docker run --rm -it -p 80:80 vulnerables/web-dvwa

Confirmed that DVWA was accessible via http://localhost.


2. Setting Up DVWA

Accessed DVWA in the browser using http://127.0.0.1.

Logged in with the provided credentials:

Username: admin

Password: password

Initialized the DVWA database by clicking "Create / Reset Database" on the setup page.

Logged in again and confirmed the DVWA application was running.

3. BurpSuite Configuration

Opened the BurpSuite browser via Target > Open Browser and navigated to http://localhost.

Ensured BurpSuite Proxy was active and correctly intercepting traffic.

4. Subtask 1: Intercepting Traffic

Opened the Proxy tab in BurpSuite and turned interception ON.

Performed the following actions:

Attempted to log in with incorrect credentials to generate traffic.

Observed the intercepted requests in the HTTP history.

Logged in with correct credentials while interception was still active:

Username: admin

Password: password.

Intercepted the POST request and modified the User-Agent header to include:

Value: My name + a household item (e.g., User-Agent: Kettle).

5. Reviewing and Saving the Modified Request



Forwarded the modified POST request and completed the login process.

Turned interception OFF.

Reviewed the HTTP history to locate the modified request:

Switched to the Edited Request view to confirm the changes.

Captured screenshots showing:

Edited POST request in raw format.

HTTP history, including timestamps, methods, and ports.

6. Submission

#Subtask 2: Repeater (0.25p)
Based on the repeated requests and responses analyzed in BurpSuite's Repeater:

Observation:

The dvwaSession cookie changes with each repeated request.
The values appear to be randomly generated, with no discernible pattern or inclusion of timestamps.
Inference:

The session ID generation method likely utilizes a secure randomization algorithm to ensure uniqueness for each session.
This randomness makes it difficult for an attacker to predict or brute-force valid session IDs.
Attached Screenshots
The following screenshots demonstrate the observed changes in the dvwaSession cookie:

Screenshot 1 (Repeater Request & Response 1): Shows the initial session ID generated after the request.
Screenshot 2 (Repeater Request & Response 2): Displays the subsequent session ID, highlighting its change.
These screenshots provide clear evidence of how session IDs are updated with each request.


#Subtask 3: Intruder.
To perform the brute force attack using BurpSuite's Intruder tool, the security level in DVWA was first set to Low. Then, the Brute Force tab was accessed within DVWA, where an initial login attempt was made using the credentials user and pass. This attempt was captured in BurpSuite Proxy > HTTP History, specifically identifying the GET request containing the username and password parameters.

The captured request was then sent to the Intruder tool by right-clicking on it and selecting Send to Intruder. In the Intruder tab, the payload positions were configured by highlighting the values of the username and password fields and adding placeholders (ยง). The attack type was set to Cluster Bomb, allowing multiple payload combinations to be tested simultaneously.

Next, payloads were configured in the Payloads tab. For the username field (Payload Set 1), a list of potential usernames, including admin, gordonb, the first name, and surname, was added. Similarly, for the password field (Payload Set 2), a list of potential passwords, such as password, abc123, letmein, and others, was included.

The attack was initiated by clicking Start Attack, and BurpSuite systematically tested all combinations of usernames and passwords. The results were displayed in the Intruder interface, showing the status codes, response lengths, and other details for each attempt. A successful login was identified based on the HTTP status code 302 (indicating a redirection), differentiating it from failed attempts.

Screenshots were captured to document the process, including the Intruder setup and results showing the successful attack. These screenshots serve as evidence of how the brute force attack was conducted and highlight the vulnerabilities present in the DVWA application under low-security settings.


# Subtask 4: Decoder
In this task, I explored the Decoder functionality in BurpSuite. The process began with opening the Decoder tab, where I entered my name and student number, "Sohaib Saeed x15 68264", into the input section.

Original Input: I wrote the text "Sohaib Saeed x15 68264" in the text area of the Decoder tab.
Encoding:
First, I used the "Encode as URL" option to encode the input text. This step converted the original input into a URL-encoded format where certain characters (e.g., spaces) were replaced with their respective encoded values.
Next, I used the "Encode as HTML" option to encode the input as HTML, which is commonly used to render special characters in web browsers.
Smart Decode:
After encoding the input, I used the Smart Decode feature to automatically detect the encoding format and revert the data back to its original form. This demonstrated how Decoder simplifies the process of working with encoded data in web security testing.
The screenshot provided shows the text entered in the Decoder, showcasing the input and encoding operations performed.



To perform the brute force attack on the DVWA login page, we utilized Hydra, a powerful tool for password cracking. First, we prepared the Hydra command specifying the admin username and a password list file (passwords.txt) located in the /root directory of the Kali Linux Docker container. The target was set to the DVWA login form running on 127.0.0.1, and the form's parameters (username, password, and Login) were configured based on the HTTP POST request observed in Burp Suite. The success condition was identified as a redirect to index.php. After executing the command, Hydra attempted to brute force the login credentials but encountered connection issues due to the disabled child mode. This concludes the testing phase with Hydra.
